Module Code: 52465

Project instructions as given by Dr. Brian McGinley:
"Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook."
